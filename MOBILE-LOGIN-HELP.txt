🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING MOBILE LOGIN:

Mobile login issues can be caused by:

1. **Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure mobile device is on same WiFi network
   - Backend server: http://192.168.0.167:5000
   - Frontend app: http://192.168.0.167:5173

2. **Browser Cache**
   - Clear mobile browser cache
   - Try incognito/private mode

3. **Firewall/Security**
   - Windows Firewall may block mobile connections
   - Try temporarily disabling Windows Firewall

4. **HTTPS/HTTP Issues**
   - Some mobile browsers prefer HTTPS
   - Use HTTP:// explicitly in URL

📱 TESTING STEPS FOR MOBILE:

1. On mobile browser, navigate to: http://192.168.0.167:5173
2. Try logging in with:
   - Username: Daniel
   - Password: 12345
3. If that fails, try:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123

🔍 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

Check backend logs for login attempt details:
- Look for "🔐 Login attempt" messages
- Check if mobile requests are reaching the server
- Verify CORS headers in response

The backend server is running and working (desktop connections successful).
The issue is likely network connectivity or mobile browser compatibility.
